A MARC-to-OpenURL crosswalk for Voyager, via Z39.50

File /includes/php-marc.php is the 2005 version of the PHP-MARC package from the Emilda project which was copyright Oy Realnode Ab and was released under a GPL 2 license. All other files authored by jdurno and are licensed under GPL 3. 

The PHP-MARC package has long since been superceded by Dan Scott's File_MARC PEAR package but I haven't bothered to update my code.
